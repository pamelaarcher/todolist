## Description
This exercise uses React along with javascript to create a to do list.  The Bootstrap framework is used as the style guide. You can type in new tasks and hit enter or click the <b>Add Task</b> button to add a new item to the list.  An "X" button on each task allows you to delete.  Clicking the checked button will mark it as complete.

## Setting Up and Running The Application
1) Clone this repository on a local machine
  - index.html is where your React app will be loaded inside the TodoBox element
  - index.js, form.js and todo.js contain the javascript functions used by the application.
2) Open a command line on your computer and run the command cd path/to/project/root (replace with actual path to the local repository)
3) Within the same command-line window, run <b>http-server -c-0</b> to start up a local http-server.   This is needed to run the react application
4) You should see the ip address for the server.  Go to a browser and enter this as URL <ip-address>/index.html
5) Enter a new task and hit enter or click on submit to add a task.

### About
This application is made up of 4 main files
  - <b>index.html</b> which includes the libraries for bootstrap,  google fonts and react as well as the main div to display.
  - <b>todo.js</b> which contains the function to create the new todo
  - <b>form.js</b> which contains the functions to add and delete todo items
  - <b>index.js</b> which contains the main app function which renders the to do list
