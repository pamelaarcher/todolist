## Description
This exercise uses React along with javascript to create a to do list.  The Bootstrap framework is used as the style guide. You can type in new tasks and hit enter or click the <b>Add Task<b> button to add a new item to the list.  An "X" button on each task allows you to delete.  Clicking the checked button will mark it as complete.

## Setting Up and Running The Application

### About
This application is made up of 3 main files
  - <b>mystyle.css</b> which includes the classes for the ball and the box container on the page.
  - <b>index.html</b> which includes the functions to create 100 red and blue balls with random positions and velocity, check the walls to ensure that they do not go outside the boundaries and update the direction when boundaries are hit.
  - <b>ball.js</b> which contains the function which makes the ball and pushes it into the body of the web page box

### Running the Application
 (1) You can download these 3 files to a directory on your local drive.  Once installed in a directory, run the index.html file from a new web page OR you can run the application direct from github from the link, https://pamelaarcher.github.io/bigbang/  <br />
